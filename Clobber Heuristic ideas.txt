Heuristic 1: Isolate opponent pieces, count each orphaned opponent piece (cannot make a move)

Heuristic 2: count up adjacent pieces belonging to George, for every two that are adjacent if there
is an opponent piece that can move on one of them add 1 to the heuristic to make it more desirable

Heuristic 3: Count up number of pieces adjacent

Heuristic 4: Center control: count up number of pieces in the center of the board
				(can change quickly to subtract by number of opponent pieces as well)

Heuristic 5: Edge Control: count up number of pieces on the edge of the board
				(can change quickly to subtract by number of opponent pieces as well)

Heuristic 6: count up number of possible moves we have

Heuristic 7: count up number of possible moves opponent has... this should be the same as the other one
		I'm going to revise both 6 and 7 to be the number of pieces we/opponent has that can move
			that number will be different in some cases
Question regarding 6 & 7, do we want to have more or fewer of our pieces to be able to move
and do we want more or fewer of our opponent pieces to move, this will impact the score
For example, I would consider it a good thing if three of their pieces were touching one of our pieces
and were on an "island" as taking that piece would remove all three of their pieces from play.

Heuristic 8: count up number of possible moves we have-number of possible moves opponent has
		following the revisions to heuristics 6 and 7 this will simply call those heuristics
			and subtract the result of 7 from the result of 6
